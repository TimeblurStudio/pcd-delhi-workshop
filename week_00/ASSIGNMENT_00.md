We are going to develop our compositions starting from 2-5 "Notes" over the course of the semester. Your assignment for this week is to create, find, or choose 2-5 discrete sonic events and create some kind of document of your selection. Consider the relationships between your Notes.

Notes do not need to be inherently pitched or musical; you can think of them as gestures or events.

The documentation of your selection can be a recording, traditional notation, blog post or something else. This document will serve as a record of your process.
