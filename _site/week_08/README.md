## Installations

### Spatialization

A simple way to create interesting and engaging interaction is simply using the physical properties of sound spatialized around a room. 

#### [Dream House - La Monte Young, Marian Zazeela](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC6bhnu5Luc&nohtml5=False)

Dream House is simply a handful of specially-tuned sine wave generators. As you move around in the space, the waves collide with each other in different waves changing the spectral content of what you hear. It's extremely responsive, interactive and uses entirely analog and passive electronics. 

#### [Microtonal Wall - Sarah Rara, Tristan Perich](https://vimeo.com/45225412)

Similar to the Dream House, Microtonal Wall is an installation which the listener experiences by exploring a space.

#### [Forty Part Motet - Janet Cardiff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxIeulpigws)

Janet Cardiff's work often employs the technique of using speakers to embody people or characters. Her work is immersive and the interaction is simply moving around the space. 

#### [Zimoun](https://vimeo.com/7235817)

Zimoun uses materials and motors to create aleatoric musical installations. 

#### [77 Million Paintings - Brian Eno](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQllM0qx3c0)

### Tracking

Camera tracking is useful way to create unencumbered interfaces where users are free to move and explore easily. It typically affords whole-body or body-scale interaction over fine-tuned manual interaction.

#### [Delqa - Music by Mathew Dear](http://www.daveandgabe.care/delqa-1)

#### [Firewall - Aaron Sherwood, Mike Allison](https://vimeo.com/54882144)

Great example of mapping pressure and dynamics in an interesting way. 

#### [Trechery Of Sanctuary - Chris Milk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2kZdl8hs_s)

Chris Milk's piece effectively employs sound to heighten the experience. The forceful sound of the flapping wings slows the user down and makes them embody the bird.  

### Instrument

Abstracted instruments are another way of creating interactive music. A challenge here is to create instruments that are accessible and immediately understandable. 

#### [Blow Up - Scott Snibbe](http://www.snibbe.com/projects/interactive/blowup/)

Augments the users breath using large fans.

#### [Reactable - Sergi Jordà, Marcos Alonso, Martin Kaltenbrunner and Günter Geiger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0h-RhyopUmc&nohtml5=False)

A table with a camera underneath tracks fiducial markers on blocks. The placement and rotation of the blocks controls music music or sound effects.

#### [Playing the Building - David Byrne](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gea9SYUdJeY)

Byrne connected a piano keyboard to trigger motors and actuators around the building. Great use of space and materials. 

### Environmental

#### [Subway Symphony - James Murphy](http://pitchfork.com/news/54088-james-murphy-previews-music-for-new-york-city-subway-stations/)

A proposed project which puts a lot of musical attention to the sound design of the New York Subway system. Reappropriation of everyday objects/sounds.

#### [Strings - Monica Bate, Johann Diedrick, Luisa Pereira](https://vimeo.com/84474194)

Very architecturally striking design. Maps string plucks / stretches to samples and synthesis. 

#### [21 Balançoires (21 Swings) -  Daily tous les jours](https://vimeo.com/40980676)

Playful public installation where swinging on swings generates music. Clear mapping and lots of variation in rhythm and melody. 

#### [Piano Stairs - Remo Saraceni](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOVHNGeDxKE)

Not great sound design / composition (IMO), but very clear mapping. 

#### [Voice Array - Rafael Lozano-Hemmer](http://www.trendhunter.com/trends/voice-array-by-rafael-lozanohemmer)

# Cohesion with Visual Music

How do sounds interact with visuals? 

How do you create cohesion between color/sound/form/movement/concept?

[Ligeti - Artikulation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71hNl_skTZQ)

[Synchromy - Norm McLaren](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmSzc8mBJCM)

[Dots - Norm McLaren](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3-vsKwQ0Cg)

[Matrix III - John Whitney](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrKgyY5aDvA)

What is an intuitive mapping between sound and visuals? 

Music exists in time, so perhaps clear mappings have to do more with movement and gesture (Spectromorphology) than with shape and color.

### Conceptual Clarity / Cohesion with Interactive Music

## IN CLASS

3 Short (5 minute) drawing exercises. Listen to these short samples and draw shapes which you feel represent. The exploration here is to see if we have some kind of shared mapping between/gesture/form/color.
