## WHAT IS MUSIC?

> "the science or art of ordering tones or sounds in succession, in combination, and in temporal relationships to produce a composition having unity and continuity" \*
> 
> Webster's Collegiate Dictionary

\*I don't like this definition. 

>"Music is organized sound."
>
> Edgard Varese

### Silence

[John Cage on Silence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcHnL7aS64Y)

### Noise vs Music

> Jean-Jacques Nattiez considers the difference between noise and music nebulous, explaining that "The border between music and noise is always culturally defined—which implies that, even within a single society, this border does not always pass through the same place; in short, there is rarely a consensus ... By all accounts there is no single and intercultural universal concept defining what music might be"
>
> [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definition_of_music)

### Xenakis - Formalized Music

1. It is a sort of comportment necessary for whoever thinks it and makes it.
2. It is an individual pleroma, a realization.
3. It is a fixing in sound of imagined virtualities (cosmological, philosophical, . . ., arguments)
4. It is normative, that is, unconsciously it is a model for being or for doing by sympathetic drive.
5. It is catalytic: its mere presence permits internal psychic or mental transformations in the same way as the crystal ball of the hypnotist.
6. It is the gratuitous play of a child.
7. It is a mystical (but atheistic) asceticism. Consequently, expressions of sadness, joy, love and dramatic situations are only very limited particular instances.


## PROCESS

Poietic vs Realization

> "By 'poietic' I understand describing the link among the composer's intentions, his [or her] creative procedures, his [or her] mental schemas, and the result of this collection of strategies; that is, the components that go into the work's material embodiment. Poietic description thus also deals with a quite special form of hearing (Varese called it 'the interior ear'): what the composer hears while imagining the work's sonorous results, or while experimenting at the piano, or with tape."
> 
> Jean-Jacques Nattiez

Realization - a process of music production. 

## CELLS

Starting from the bottom...

A musical ["cell"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_%28music%29) is the smallest germ of an idea. Cells can be developed into Motifs and musical Material. Always try to find more in what you already have. A "pregnant" cell might be all the stuff you need to develop a piece of music.

[Beethoven's 5th](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRgXUFnfKIY)

## 20th CENTURY TECHNIQUES

### Aleatoric

> Aleatoric music (from the Latin word alea, meaning "dice") is music in which some element of the composition is left to chance, and/or some primary element of a composed work's realization is left to the determination of its performer(s)
>
> Wikipedia - [Aleatoric Music](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleatoric_music)

#### [Variations I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8DiCEfa7ME) - John Cage - 1958


* Points representing sound characteristics are placed on a board
* Lines are dropped on the board and the sound is interpreted by the proximity to the points.

> Six transparent sheets having single straight lines. Five having points. The sheets are to be superimposed partially or wholly separated on a suitable surface. Drop perpendiculars by means of any rule obtaining readings thereby for (1) frequency, (2) amplitude, (3) timbre, (4)duration, (5) point of occurrence in an established period of time, (6) structure of event (number of sounds making up an aggregate or constellation). A single use of all sheets yields thirty determinations.

### Stochastic

Stochastic music typically models a process (physical or otherwise) and leaves elements of that process up to chance.

> Stochastic comes from the Greek word στόχος, which means "aim". It also denotes a target stick; the pattern of arrows around a target stick stuck in a hillside is representative of what is stochastic. 
>
> Wikipedia - [Stochastic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic)

#### [Pithoprakta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AE1M2iwjTsM) - Iannis Xenakis - 1956

* Mathematical processes based on probability that generate stochastic elements.
* Piece is based on statistical mechanics of gasses, Guassian distribution and Brownian Motion.
* Each instrument is conceived as a molecule obeying the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution law, with Gaussian distribution of temperature fluctuation.

### Process Music

#### [Piano Phase](http://www.pianophase.com/) - Steve Riech - 1966

(Visualization by Alexander Chen)

Process: 

1. Both performers play the pattern over and over again. One performer starts, the other fades in in unison (bars 1–2).
2. The first performer keeps a constant tempo. The other performer gradually increases his tempo, until he is one note ahead of the first performer (bar 3)
3. After playing in synchronization for a while, the second performer again begins increasing his tempo, and the phase shifting process starts again (bars 3–4)

Transfer the phase shifting processes he explored in tape pieces like [It’s gonna Rain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vugqRAX7xQE) to live instrumental performance

### Open Form

#### [In C](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjR4QYsa9nE) - Terry Riley - 1964

* Each performer plays a measure for as long as they want and then goes onto the next one.
* [Score](http://www.flagmusic.com/content/clips/inc.pdf)

#### [Cobra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m1pjR1AQbc) - John Zorn - 1984

* Game Piece: A detailed set of rules for a group of improvisers
* A conductor leads the groups and gives the cues.

### Spectralism

>...spectral music is an acoustic musical practice where compositional decisions are often informed by sonographic representations and mathematical analysis of sound spectra, or by mathematically generated spectra. 
>
> [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_music)

This piece is composed from a the spectrogram of an E2 played on Trombone. 

[Gérard Grisey - Partiels (1975)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqzukP_BtW8)

### Twelve-Tone Music

The technique is a means of ensuring that all 12 notes of the chromatic scale are sounded as often as one another in a piece of music while preventing the emphasis of any one note

[Arnold Schoenberg - Piece for Piano Op. 33a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1hPqZdrAyk)

### Computer Assisted Improvisation

#### [Interactive Trio](http://vimeo.com/23556704) - George Lewis - 2011

* Interactive performance system listens and responds to musical input. 
* Output is a transformation of the input material.


## NOW _EVERYONE_ MAKES MUSIC

Not **EVERYONE** but a lot of people. The tools are cheaper, easier to use, and more accessible than ever before. 

All of these above techniques assume a stage, audience, instruments, musical training on the part of the interacter/performer. Now it's easier than ever to make music and stream it over the internet. No stage, no instruments, musical training optional. 

So where does the "artist", "composer", "musician" fit in? Perhaps in making implementation choices which can affect much wider audiences than any single musical work. 

Thoughts? 

#### LAURIE SPEIGEL

> I automate whatever can be automated to be freer to focus on those aspects of music that can't be automated. The challenge is to figure out which is which.

[Music Mouse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIqS5_bh4nM)

#### ROBERT HENKE

Composer and co-developer of Ableton Live. 

His views on composition and music have effected TONS of music producers and millions of music listeners. 

### Roles: Human / Process

Some of the above examples include defining a process to generate pitches and durations and then having a human player perform these sounds. Others use a player to affect a process which realizes the music. 

|                  | Human Performed                   | Process Performed                    |
|:----------------:|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Human Composed  | Traditional Music.                 | Interactive Music / Video Game Music / DAWs? |
| Process Composed | Aleatoric/Stochastic/Process Music | Data Sonification?                   |

## WHY INTERACTION?

Why make something interactive?

Why make interactive music?

Why NOT make interactive music?

## EXPERIMENTS


### Performing Cobra: 

Group improvisation. 

1. Pick one word to use as your musical instrument.
2. Four Musical actions: 
	* **\+** is MORE
	* **\-** is LESS
	* **=** is EQUAL
	* **.** is END
3. A conductor will cue participants in these 4 actions for a group improvisation.
