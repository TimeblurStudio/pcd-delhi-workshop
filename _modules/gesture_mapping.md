### Complexity / Transparency

An entirely transparent 

* Feedback
* Complexity to stimulate creativity
* Transparency to keep link between input and resulting
sound (otherwise, danger of loosing the audience) 

## Mapping function

A mapping function transforms the input gesture to the output sound. 

#### One to One

Each gesture / input is mapped directly to one output. Clear and simple. Not terribly exciting. 

#### One to Many

One input controls multiple outputs. Higher level control but less control over details. Powerful. 

#### Many to One

Many inputs coupled to produce one musical parameter. Allows for greater expressive control and mastery. Finer degree of control. (e.g. Frequency and Detune knob). 

## Indeterminacy

Non-linear, non-deterministic control can add intrigue and interest to your interface, but too much of it will make the interface feel arbitrary and non-responsive. 

### Levels of indeterminacy

* Control vs. randomness (interactive improvisation)
* Total pre-determinacy: push play -> deterministic output. 
* Total indeterminacy: random machines. 

### Continuous vs. discrete control 

* Micro- to macro-level control: sound spectrum to details of
articulation to overall structure

## DIMENSIONS

Dimensionality and parameterization are important concepts for interactive music. Often times users are given an interaction an a specific dimension. The higher-level the dimension (i.e. "energy" vs "loudness", "dance-ability" vs "tempo"), the more engaging and approachable the interaction.
