Sound is a vibration that propagates as an audible mechanical wave of pressure and displacement, through a medium such as air or water.

#### Frequency

The number of occurrences of a repeating oscillation per unit time. 1 hertz is 1 cycle per second. 

Frequency vs Pitch...

#### Wavelength

The length of 1 cycle. 

* 20hz wave is 17 meters long. 
* 20,000hz wave is 17 millimeters long. 

#### Amplitude

The magnitude of the wave. The difference between extreme values. DIFFERENT than volume.

#### Phase

Phase difference is the difference, expressed in degrees or time, between two waves having the same frequency and referenced to the same point in time.

#### Summing and Subtracting waves

When two waves are in phase, their amplitudes sum. If they are out of phase, their amplitudes subtract. 

### TERMINOLOGY

* Octave - the interval between one musical pitch and another with half or double its frequency.
* Decibel - a logarithmic scale used to measure sound level. 
* Fundamental Frequency - the lowest frequency of a periodic waveform. 
* Attenuation - decrease/increase in a signal. loudness. 
* Gain - increase/decrease in amplitude of a signal.
