### Spatialization

A simple way to create interesting and engaging interaction is simply using the physical properties of sound spatialized around a room.

#### [Dream House - La Monte Young, Marian Zazeela](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC6bhnu5Luc)

Dream House is simply a handful of specially-tuned sine wave generators. As you move around in the space, the waves collide with each other in different waves changing the spectral content of what you hear. It's extremely responsive, interactive and uses entirely analog and passive electronics.

#### [Microtonal Wall - Sarah Rara, Tristan Perich](https://vimeo.com/45225412)

Similar to the Dream House, Microtonal Wall is an installation which the listener experiences by exploring a space.

#### [Forty Part Motet - Janet Cardiff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxIeulpigws)

Janet Cardiff's work often employs the technique of using speakers to embody people or characters. Her work is immersive and the interaction is simply moving around the space.

#### [Zimoun](https://vimeo.com/7235817)

Zimoun uses materials and motors to create aleatoric musical installations.

### Tracking

#### [Firewall - Aaron Sherwood, Mike Allison](https://vimeo.com/54882144)

Great example of mapping pressure and dynamics in an interesting way.

#### [Trechery Of Sanctuary - Chris Milk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2kZdl8hs_s)

Chris Milk's piece effectively employs sound to heighten the experience of the piece. The forceful sound of the flapping wings slows the user down and makes them embody the bird.  

### Instrument

#### [Reactable - Sergi Jordà, Marcos Alonso, Martin Kaltenbrunner and Günter Geiger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgy1S8qymx0)

A table with a camera underneath tracks fiducial markers on blocks. The placement and rotation of the blocks controls music music or sound effects.

#### [Playing the Building - David Byrne](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gea9SYUdJeY)

Byrne connected a piano keyboard to trigger motors and actuators around the building. Great use of space and materials.

### Environmental

#### [Subway Symphony - James Murphy](http://pitchfork.com/news/54088-james-murphy-previews-music-for-new-york-city-subway-stations/)

A proposed project which puts a lot of musical attention to the sound design of the New York Subway system.

#### [Strings - Monica Bate, Johann Diedrick, Luisa Pereira Hors](https://vimeo.com/84474194)

Very architecturally striking design. Maps string plucks / stretches to samples and synthesis.

#### [21 Balançoires (21 Swings) -  Daily tous les jours](https://vimeo.com/40980676)

Playful public installation where swinging on swings generates music. Clear mapping and lots of variation in rhythm and melody.

#### [Piano Stairs - Remo Saraceni](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOVHNGeDxKE)

Not great sound design / composition (IMO), but very clear mapping.

#### [Voice Array - Rafael Lozano-Hemmer](http://www.trendhunter.com/trends/voice-array-by-rafael-lozanohemmer)

Participants record a short audio segment which is stored for later listeners.

#### [Global String by Atau Tanaka (2000)](https://vimeo.com/46800992)

Connected via the Internet. real time sound synthesis.

## Affordances/Constraints

Musical installations will often give you a captive audience which is great for more in depth interaction.

A timed experience (especially one with a beginning and end) can be a little more difficult with an installation since people will often come and go.

Speaker placement is very important for clarity of the sound and for listeners to understand the source/sound mapping.
