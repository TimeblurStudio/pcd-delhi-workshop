Encapsulate your Notes into a Function Object. Give your object an expressive interface that you can use. 

By abstracting and encapsulating your discrete sonic events, you have made them into a unit. With that unit you can start to explore and generate Sentences and larger forms. 

The focus of this assignment is on making useful abstractions of your Notes. You should be able to play them as a group in a variety of ways with a consistent API. The more implementation details you can hide the better; think about **high-level** gestures, combinations and motifs.
