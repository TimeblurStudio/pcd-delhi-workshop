layout: default
---

Get into groups of 3 or 4. Together you will develop a "paper prototype" of an interactive musical instrument/composition. 

Your paper prototype should be centered around a gesture/interaction and create some kind of sonic output. 

Have an audience or group member perform your instrument/interface/composition. 

Focus on these three elements: 

* Introduction which explains the mapping/metaphor
* Exposition
* Ending
