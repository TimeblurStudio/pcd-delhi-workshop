Get into small groups. I will pass out small snippets of Rainer Wehinger ["HÃ¶rpartitur"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphic_notation) or "score for listening" to Ligeti's Artikulation. Create a performance of the score to present in front of the class. 

Unlike most scores which are sort of like the source code to the music, this graphic representation of Ligeti's tape piece was created _after_ the music was published; The assignment is to create music from visuals from music.
