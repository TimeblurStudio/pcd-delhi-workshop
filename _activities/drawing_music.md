**What is an intuitive mapping between sound and visuals?**

3 Short (6 minute) drawing excercises. Listen to these short samples and draw a visual representation of them. I will play each twice.

Try representing timbre:

{% include youtube.html video='zIqS5_bh4nM' end=180 %}

Try representing space:
