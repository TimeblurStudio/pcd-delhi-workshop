Cobra is a group improvisation technique developed by John Zorn in New York in the 1980s. It is arranged for a group of improvisers and a conductor. 

The composition consists of a set of cues notated on cards, and rules corresponding to the cues that direct the players what to do. The number of players, instrumentation, and length of the piece is indeterminate.
