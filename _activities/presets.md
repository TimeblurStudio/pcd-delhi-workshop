Make some Tone.js synth and effect settings. You sounds should be discrete and be between ~0-20 seconds. 

You can fork [this fiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/yotammann/20vbdsyL/) to start. 

Try to make sounds that you find interesting and novel. You can chain together as many synths and effects as you want.
