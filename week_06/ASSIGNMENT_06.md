Design and realize an interaction for your musical material.

Be intentional with your interaction. How/why does it match your Material. Consider what are you asking of your users to do. Who is using this? 

You will be presenting your interactive Material next week. Put your assignment in a distributable site (either your own domain or codepen/jsfiddle). Presentations will be 2 or 3 minutes. Be prepared to discuss your choices with the class.
