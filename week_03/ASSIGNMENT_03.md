Apply a random process to your Notes. The process could be adding some random or probabilistic process to _when_, _if_, or _for how long_ your Notes are played for. The timbre or spectromorphology could be controlled probabilistically.

Experiment with applying the same random process to multiple parameters or characteristics.

Work with the probability to make it musical. Why or how did you choose the probabilities you did? When does randomness become noise? What is noise to you?

Document your process and/or create some artifact.
