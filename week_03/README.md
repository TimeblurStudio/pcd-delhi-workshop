## Randomness

#### Play (or don't) with some probability

## Random Melody Generator

#### Generate Material by randomly selecting from an array of notes.

* Make the synth
* Make the array of notes
* Schedule a series of random notes.

What kind of music does this make? What sort of musical decisions is there to make with this technique? Where can you take it from here? 

#### Let's Constrain the movement. 

* Pick the next note based on the current note.
	* When a random value is above 0.5, move to the next note up
	* When below, move one note down
* Constrain the values to the length of our array

## Markov Chords

Markov chains define states and probability of moving from one state to another. We'll use chords as our states and define a way of moving from one state to another. 

![Basic Markov Chain](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2b/Markovkate_01.svg/220px-Markovkate_01.svg.png)

* First make the possible chord paths from one chord to the next. 
* Given there are only two choices between either state, flip a coin and choose one or the other. 
* Play those chords on a PolySynth
* Maybe even add a bass part.

## Probability Drums

On every step of our sequencer, we will decide whether or not to play a drum part on that step given a probability table. 

* Make a drum kit. 
* Make some sliders with 16 steps. 
	* zero them out
* On every step, generate a random number and compare it to the probability at that step

#### Interpolated Probabilities

By adjusting the probability over time can add interesting progression to music.
