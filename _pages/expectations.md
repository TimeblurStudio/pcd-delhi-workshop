This class is an exchange; we all have something to offer. Be generous!

Be an engaged student. Listen to your classmates, create for them and with them, give compliments, give feedback, share references and knowledge. 

**Lids down** while your classmates are presenting/talking. You can use your computers the rest of the time to supplement/research/dive deeper into what we're discussing in class. Please don't mindlessly flip through your feed or email. 

## Timing

I will be on time or early to class and I expect the same from you. There will be one 15 minute break in the middle of class. If you require more breaks, please talk to me.

Let me know in advance if you need to be excused for an absence (emergencies only!).
