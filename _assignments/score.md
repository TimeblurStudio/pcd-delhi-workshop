Envision a piece of music and then symbolically represent it. Your representation should not take the form of staff notation. Instead, devise an alternative representation such as text, graphing or drawing. 

You will be realizing these scores for the midterm. Use the process of notation to help your conceive your piece and also illustrate your conception of the music to others.
