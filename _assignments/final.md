Create a piece of interactive music which will be presented/performed for/with/to the class and guest critics of approximately 3-5 minutes in duration.

Your piece will be performed by someone else. Coordinate with the person(s) ahead of time so they have time to understand the goals and intentions of your piece and time to practice if necessary.

Javascript is encouraged, but you can use any language or platform you want.
