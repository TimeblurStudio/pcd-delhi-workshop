title : Midterm 2 - Gesture
layout: default
---

Create a piece centered around a gesture. Like a violinist uses the gesture of bowing to realize a notated score, you will realize your composition through a gesture that you define, measure and map to sound.

The gesture could be simple like moving the mouse up and down on a page or complex like tracking facial expression. Focus on creating a clear and intuitive mapping from gesture to sound. Think about the dimensionality of control of your gesture. Aim to give the player power and ability to sculpt your music. 

The piece can either be performed by you or a volunteer in the class. (Coordinate with your volunteer before class).
