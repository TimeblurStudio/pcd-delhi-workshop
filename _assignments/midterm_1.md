Realize your graphic scores. Your realization needs to be rendered (at least in part) using code. The code does not need to be complex; it can be as simple as playing a few mp3 files using p5.sound, or as advanced as synthesizing all sounds in real time. But use code as a tool to realize your piece.

If your score is very complex, consider simplifying, or only realizing a small piece of it. 

You will present your pieces in front of the class next week. In your presentation, show your score and discuss your process of realization.
